Hello.
The Final_Overview file is an unfinished version of the Technical Document. This is because I was using CirkitDesigner as my website to show my circuit and it stopped working while I was doing it. So,
I used the 30 minutes of grace to finish it up and upload it as a new pdf, which is the Final_TechDoc. I included both as I was not sure if that was what the 30 minutes of grace was for, so I wanted to be safe
rather than sorry. Both pdfs should have the github repository link as well as the video link.
